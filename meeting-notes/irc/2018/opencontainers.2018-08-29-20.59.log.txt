21:21:34 <vbatts|work> some windows PRs would be good to get in for a release

21:22:15 <vbatts|work> there was something that broke lxc. That needs to be reverted and resolved before moving forward.

21:29:41 <vbatts|work> #topic distribution-spec
21:31:40 <vbatts|work> /v2/_catalog is like a paginating admin function
21:31:51 <vbatts|work> not ideal for search by clients
21:32:43 <vbatts|work> for companion services like flagstate, it would be best to have it only do triggers from new
21:50:38 <vbatts|work> OPTIONAL catalog api
21:50:50 <vbatts|work> #topic distribution client lib
21:51:29 <vbatts|work> conformance testing basically requires blessing one
21:51:33 <vbatts|work> there are so many
21:52:05 <vbatts|work> auth is not really a conformance thing, but may be required
21:58:21 <vbatts|work> line 88 about client error codes?
21:58:26 <vbatts|work> say consumer?
21:58:37 <vbatts|work> /v2/ consumer requirements
22:01:28 <vbatts|work> something like the ./specs-go/ of image-spec and runtime-spec
