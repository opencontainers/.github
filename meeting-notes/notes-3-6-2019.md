## Contribution Workflow

Discussed briefly adding a folder for proposals and meetings notes to the org repo, [issue created](https://github.com/opencontainers/org/issues/12)
and more discussion next week. 
 - [Original PR](https://github.com/opencontainers/org/pull/6) to add contributing docs to the org repo, and 
 - [Just adding Contributing Docs](https://github.com/opencontainers/org/pull/9) is the consolidated version to break apart the pull requests. 
 - [Web Preview](https://vsoch.github.io/org/) is the web preview for the pull request PR (I'll keep it updated with the add/contributing-docs PR)

## Cgroup v2

Mostly a heads up regarding more imminent arrival of cgroup v2 in distributions. Ubuntu latest releases already providing unified mount. Fedora (2? : vbatts?) potentially switching with boot flag.

## Distribution-spec

Discussion covering the open issues against the [v1.0.0-rc1 milestone in GitHub](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/milestone/3). 

Specific discussion on removing references to Docker v2 schema 1 manifests (issue [#47](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/issues/47)) and vendor-specific HTTP headers (issue [#26](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/issues/26)).

Vincent added issue [#39](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/pull/39) to the milestone: Dongsu's ocicert tests.

We need a proposal for the way forward on https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/issues/22
JimmiZ says that `_catalog` and search are tied together.
The clair model is registering with a registry, so new pushes to the registry trigger a webhook to call the scan.
SteveLas - correlating the listing and eventing together would be a good scenario to cover. Possibly cover the requirements of a catalog/listing API. Mike suggested starting this now, and seeing if we can land it before 1.0 ships.
