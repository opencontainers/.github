# The Open Container Initiative

Welcome to the Open Containers Initiative documentation site! The Open Container 
Initiative cares about open, industry standards for container technology.
Broadly, technology encompasses two prominent ideas:

 - *formats*: What exactly *is* a container?
 - *interaction*: How do we run, create, pull, or otherwise interact with a container?

## What will I find here?

This is a collection of introductory material to help you to understand containers,
the specifications that were created to support them, and finally, how
you can contribute to OCI.
