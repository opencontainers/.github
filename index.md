# The Open Container Initiative

Welcome to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) documentation site! The Open Container 
Initiative cares about open, industry standards for container technology.
Broadly, technology encompasses two prominent ideas:

 - *formats*: What exactly *is* a container?
 - *interaction*: How do we run, create, pull, or otherwise interact with a container?

## What will I find here?

This is a collection of introductory material to help you to understand containers,
the specifications that were created to support them, and finally, how
you can contribute to OCI.
