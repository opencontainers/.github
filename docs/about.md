## About OCI

The Open Containers initiative was established in June 2015 by 
[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), one of the many
early leaders of the container industry that provided an intuitive API to interact
with [linux containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization)).

### Challenges for OCI

Why did the OCI get established in the first place? This is a longer, more complicated
story that will be updated by maintainers who can recollect their experience. Generally,
we can guess that there were several questions and challenges that warranted community
discussion and support:

 1. How do I interact with a container, for example, to run or stop it?
 2. How do I store contents and metadata inside of a container? 
 3. What are the minimal set of required metadata?
 4. How do I share or distribute my containers?

If containers were to be successful, meaning they would have widespread adoption
across different systems, and development of tools for interaction, answering these
questions for a single use case was not good enough. We needed an open platform
for discussion and development, and this led to the establishment of OCI.


### Continued Challenges

Container technologies change on a regular basis, as do the needs of society and
research groups. As new problems and use cases are brought to light, it's important that the
standards for containers are continually challenged to address them. For this reason,
it's up to you [to contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}contribute) your issues, thoughts, 
and questions about the OCI specifications catered to your use case. If there is an issue,
it's the responsibility of the community to discuss and address it.
